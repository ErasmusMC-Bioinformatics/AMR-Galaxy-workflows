# WMDI Analysis Pipelines

[Astrid: Short intro]


## Quickstart: Pipelines

Below are the latest versions of the Galaxy workflows (pipelines)


| Workflow                | Description                                      | Version |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| [Flye long-reads](../Flye_longreads_v3.4.ga)         | Pipeline using the Flye assembler on long reads  |  3.4    |
| Unicycler hybrid        | Unicycler assembler on both short and long reads |         |
| Unicycler long-read     | Unicycler assembler on long read data            |         |
| Unicycler short-read    | Unicycler assembler on short read data           |         |
| Miniasm/Minimap/Racon   | Superseded by Unicycler workflows                |         |



## Example outputs



## Running the pipelines

- These workflows can be imported into the Galaxy server of your choice.
- We recommend using the European Galaxy server ([usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)); it is free to use for anybody with a default of 250 GB of data storage.


### Importing the Workflows into Galaxy


1. Log in or register at the Galaxy server of your choice (e.g. [Galaxy EU](https://usegalaxy.eu))
2. Copy the URL of the workflow from the table above (or download the file to your computer)
3. Follow the [instructions to import the workflow into Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_import.html)
4. Upload your data into Galaxy
5. Run the workflow
